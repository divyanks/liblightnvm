======================
 Open-Channel SSD 2.0
======================

This introduction will go through how to retrieve device information, construct
physical addresses, issue vectorized IO, obtain media state, and introduce the
virtual block abstraction.

It will be using the command-line interface (CLI), and provide notes for the
corresponding parts of the C API. It is assumed throughout that an Open-Channel
SSD available at the path ``/dev/nvme0n1`` and that liblightnvm is installed on
the system.
